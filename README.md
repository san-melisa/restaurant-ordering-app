# Restaurant Ordering App
This project is an interactive restaurant ordering application built based on a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/Hdgwo69Dym9vVsxbuPbl0h/Mobile-Restaurant-Menu?node-id=0%3A1). You can view the live project [here](https://restaurant-ordering1-app.netlify.app/).

## About The Project
I first recreated the Figma design using HTML and CSS to build a mobile-friendly, pixel-perfect interface. Then, I added interactivity with JavaScript to allow users to add and remove menu items, proceed to checkout, and simulate payment, displaying a success message after completing the order.

### Features

  * Calculate total price dynamically.  
  * Checkout process with a mock payment modal.  
  * Display a success message after completing the order.
